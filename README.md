# Project--Hadoop-39

**In this project We will use Spark with Python to do an amazing stuff.Here we will work on the Spark DataFrame which will read this walmart_stock.csv as our dataset and complete the challenges as provided by Jose Portilla .** <br></br>

**Before jumping to the code lets understand Spark and Linear Regression First**...<br></br>

**What is Apache Spark?** <br></br>

Apache Spark‚Ñ¢ is a multi-language engine for executing data engineering, data science, and machine learning on single-node machines or clusters.<br></br>
Unify the processing of your data in batches and real-time streaming, using your preferred language: Python, SQL, Scala, Java or R.
Execute fast, distributed ANSI SQL queries for dashboarding and ad-hoc reporting. Runs faster than most data warehouses.<br></br>
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on petabyte-scale data without having to resort to downsampling.
Train machine learning algorithms on a laptop and use the same code to scale to fault-tolerant clusters of thousands of machines.<br></br>

**What is Spark DataFrames**?<br></br>

**1**: Spark 2.0 shifted towards DataFrame syntax<br></br>
**2**: are now the standard way of using Spark's ML Capabilties<br></br>
**3**: Spark Docs are still new<br></br>
**4**: DataFrame is very familiar to Pandas DataFrames<br></br>
**5**: Columns = features<br></br>
**6**: Rows = records<br></br>

**What is Linear Regression**?<br></br>
 Linear Regression is the supervised Machine Learning model in which the model finds the best fit linear line between the independent and dependent variable i.e it finds the linear relationship between the dependent and independent variable.<br></br>


**Important Note: Go through the walmart_stock.csv file before jumping to the code.**
